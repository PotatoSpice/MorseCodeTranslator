# MorseCodeTranslator
The first academic project I ever made. It's a simple Morde Code - Latin Alphabet translator with some other fun add-ons

This project was originally developed using Oracle's Netbeans IDE, in Windows platform. It uses Cygwin to emulate an eviroment in which native Ansi C can be run, ergo, Unix systems. In order to run, we recommend usage of said IDE and tool.
